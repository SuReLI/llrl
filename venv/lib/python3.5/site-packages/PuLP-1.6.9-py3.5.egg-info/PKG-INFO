Description: # pulp [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/coin-or/pulp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/coin-or/pulp)
        
        PuLP is an LP modeler written in python. PuLP can generate MPS or LP files
        and call GLPK[1], COIN CLP/CBC[2], CPLEX[3], and GUROBI[4] to solve linear
        problems.
        
        ## Installation
        
        The easiest way to install pulp is via [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PuLP)
        
        If pip is available on your system
        
             $pip install pulp
        
        Otherwise follow the download instructions on the PyPi page
        On Linux and OSX systems the tests must be run to make the default
        solver executable.
        
             $sudo pulptest
        
        ## Examples
        
        See the examples directory for examples.
        
        PuLP requires Python >= 2.6.
        
        The examples use the default solver (cbc), to use other solvers they must be available.
        
        # Documentation
        Documentation is found on https://pythonhosted.org/PuLP/.
        
        
        Use LpVariable() to create new variables. To create a variable 0 <= x <= 3
        
             >>> x = LpVariable("x", 0, 3)
        
        To create a variable 0 <= y <= 1
        
             >>> y = LpVariable("y", 0, 1)
        
        Use LpProblem() to create new problems. Create "myProblem"
        
             >>> prob = LpProblem("myProblem", LpMinimize)
        
        Combine variables to create expressions and constraints and add them to the
        problem.
        
             >>> prob += x + y <= 2
        
        If you add an expression (not a constraint), it will
        become the objective.
        
             >>> prob += -4*x + y
        
        To solve with the default included solver
        
             >>> status = prob.solve()
        
        To use another sovler to solve the problem.
        
             >>> status = prob.solve(GLPK(msg = 0))
        
        Display the status of the solution
        
             >>> LpStatus[status]
             'Optimal'
        
        You can get the value of the variables using value(). ex:
        
             >>> value(x)
             2.0
        
        Exported Classes:
        
        * LpProblem -- Container class for a Linear programming problem
        * LpVariable -- Variables that are added to constraints in the LP
        * LpConstraint -- A constraint of the general form
        
              a1x1+a2x2 ...anxn (<=, =, >=) b
        
        *  LpConstraintVar -- Used to construct a column of the model in column-wise modelling
        
        Exported Functions:
        
        * value() -- Finds the value of a variable or expression
        * lpSum() -- given a list of the form [a1*x1, a2x2, ..., anxn] will construct
        a linear expression to be used as a constraint or variable
        * lpDot() --given two lists of the form [a1, a2, ..., an] and
        [ x1, x2, ..., xn] will construct a linear epression to be used
        as a constraint or variable
