# Lipschitz Lifelong Reinforcement Learning

Value transfer experiments leveraging Lipschitz continuity of the optimal Q value function across MDPs.

## Use

The code is provided with a virtual environment including all the dependencies.
In order to use this virtual environment, you need to run the following command from this directory:

    source venv/bin/activate
    
From there, you can run the script using the embedded python version.
